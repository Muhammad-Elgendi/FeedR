Project background and goals

Feedr main goal is to provide the user with a tool that helps him/her to save his/her time while surfing the
Internet.
Once the user enters the URL of the website into our system, the system will fetch all articles that exist on it
and keep the user up to date with latest updates of that website.So the user can save his/her time without
surfing his/her favourite websites over and over.

General specification
Feedr is an RSS/ATOM aggregator for you to read and organize news and updates from all your favourite
websites in one place. It lets you check the news on the go, without hassle, personal data tracking or
overwhelming functionality.

System users (stakeholders)
Feedr has the following stakeholder groups, arranged according to their importance
1. Users (most important)
Users: Feedr users are the stakeholder group that receives the top prioritization. Users are
significant because they determine the popularity and attractiveness of softwareâ€™s display
advertising service. Advertisers are more likely to pay for such service as the software gains more
users. As stakeholders, users are interested in the ease of using the application services and
privacy of personal information. Thus, we must satisfy the main interests of users as stakeholders.
